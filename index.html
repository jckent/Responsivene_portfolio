        <h1> About Me</h1>
        <img src= "assets/images/bio_pic.jpg">
        <p>I am a career paramedic working for the city of Richmond, VA. I have a long term interest in computer hardware, and I am currently learning skills to become a web developer to play on these interests. I enjoy cooking, playing guitars, watching soccer (mcfc) and pretty much all things video games.
        <br> I am looking to use skills learned in web development to make a career in a position with regular challenges, and the ability to problem solve on a regular basis.
        <br> I was born at FE Warren AFB in Wyoming, and spent most of my youth moving regularly around the country. I have been in Richmond for the last 5 years, but before that I spent time in Northern VA, Maryland, Vermont, Colorado, and Ohio. </p>
